# Welcome to the Journal Documentation!

This repository hosts the documentation for Journal and the `journal` CLI. You can read the documentation [here](https://duo-labs.github.io/journal/).

While Journal is better suited for sharing information between team members instead of project documentation, we've created these docs as an instance of Journal so you can see a demo of what Journal looks like.
